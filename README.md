# Backwards Wordle

Like Wordle, just backwards.

## Rules

Objective: Guess the hidden 5-letter backwards word

Steps:
1. Enter a 5-letter word. The word must be a real English word, just spelled backwards.
2. The game will apply colors to each letter's square signifying the accuracy of your guess. 
  - A green square signifies a correct character in the correct location. 
  - A yellow square signifies a correct character in an incorrect location.
  - A grey square signifies an incorrect character.
3. The game will end when you have guessed the correct word, or if you have guessed 6 times.
